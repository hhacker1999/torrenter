# Torrenter

### A torrent movie finder client which utilises yts api to fetch torrents and downloads .torrent file to download torrent externally. As of right now you need external torrent client to connect to peers, torrenter only supports for the download of metadata file.

## Future Plans

### Initial goal was to be able to download torrent with in the app but due to lack of maintained torrent libraries for flutter, download of torrent of currently not supported but I am trying to create a torrent library. When it will be done we will be able to download torrents with in the app.

### Add support for tv shows as well. Currently trying to create a 1337x api using web scraping to download tv shows as well.
